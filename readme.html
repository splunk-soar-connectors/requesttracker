            <br><b>NOTE -</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To add a new line in action parameter value "\n" needs to be added in the parameter value (e.g. "line 1 \n line 2") for "text" and "subject" parameters of "create ticket" action, "comment" and "subject" parameters of "update ticket" action and "comment" parameter of "add attachment" action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    RequestTracker expects each new line to be preceded by a space if the text contains multiple lines, and that behavior is handled in the code for "create ticket", "update ticket" and "add attachment" actions.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Port Information</h2>
        <p>
            The app uses the HTTP/ HTTPS protocol for communicating with the RequestTracker server. Below are the default ports used by Splunk SOAR.
            <table>
                <tr class=plain>
                    <th>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service Name</th>
                    <th>Transport Protocol</th>
                    <th>Port</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
